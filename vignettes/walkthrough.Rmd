The `darn` package allows the definition of Directed Acyclic R script Networks.
A DARN is a collection of R scripts where each can have a (possibly empty)
set of prerequisites (other scripts that must be run before, and whose output is processed further).
Each R script also defines a (possibly empty) set of R objects
which are exported for use by the dependent scripts.
Unlike `remake` and other approaches, the dependencies are declared directly in the R scripts.
By design, each script can also be run individually, unchanged.
This makes it particularly easy to develop data preparation and analysis scripts
interactively, and then effortlessly integrate them in the script network
without worrying too much about interdependencies.

Each R script declares its prerequisites via a call to `darn::init()`,
and its outputs via a call to `darn::done()`;
the latter is mandatory to make the script part of the DARN.
A `Makefile` can be created from these implicit dependencies.
Running `make` only runs those scripts that are newer than their outputs,
i.e., only does as much as necessary to build the entire project.
New, modified or deleted scripts are detected,
and the dependencies are updated accordingly.

This vignette shows how to create, run, and update such a DARN.


## Creation

We create our DARN in a temporary directory.

```{r}
(root <- tempfile("darn"))
dir.create(root)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = root)
```

A DARN is defined by:

- a configuration file, the `Darnfile`, configurable by the user
- a `Makefile` which is designed to run independently but will read the options defined in the `Darnfile` if it exists; normally, the user shouldn't need to edit this file
- a `Dependencies` file, which is automatically generated and kept up to date; the user should never edit this file

The structure is created by a call to `create_makefile()`.

```{r}
darn::create_makefile(".")
```

```{bash}
cat Makefile
```

```{bash}
cat Darnfile
```

An invocation of `make` succeeds and creates a `Dependencies` file,
which currently contains only comments.

```{bash}
make
```

```{bash}
cat Dependencies
```


## Adding scripts

For starters, our network of R scripts will contain two simple scripts, `a.R` and `b.R`,
the latter depends on the former:

```{r}
setwd(root)
writeLines(c(
  "print('Defining a_result')",
  "a_result <- 42",
  "darn::done(a_result)"),
  "a.R")

writeLines(c(
  "darn::init('a')",
  "print(a_result)",
  "darn::done()"),
  "b.R")
```

The first script computes a variable `a_result` (and talks about it), which is exported and then
consumed by the second script.


## Running the DARN

Running `make` will update the `Dependencies` and run the scripts in the correct order.
By default, the scripts are run with the `ezknitr` package,
the output is a HTML file with all results and plots embedded.
In this vignette, the `script` variable is overridden to embed the results in the vignette.

```{bash}
script="R -q -e "'"'"darn::run(file = '$<', source, echo = TRUE)"'"' make
```

```{bash}
cat Dependencies
```

Running a particular script (and all of its dependencies) is supported,
the scripts will be executed only if necessary:

```{bash}
make a
```

Use the `-B` or `--always-make` switch to override:

```{bash}
make --always-make b
```


## Interactive operation

The same results are obtained by simply sourcing the script.
In particular, any missing prerequisites will be built automatically.

```{bash}
rm *.rdb *.rdx
```

```{r}
source("b.R", echo = TRUE)
```


## Working with the code

From here on, the scripts in the network can be edited, or new scripts can be added.
If a script contains a call to `darn::done()` as a top-level expression,
it will be part of the network and built automatically when calling `make`.
A caveat: The calls to `darn::init()` and `darn::done()` use heuristics to determine the name of the current file when it is sourced,
this obviously cannot work if these calls are sourced line by line (e.g., via Ctrl+Enter in RStudio).
In interactive mode, I tend to insert code that will raise an error when run,
and source the script entirely;
execution stops when reaching that manually inserted breakpoint.
Alternatively, explicitly specifying the path to the script
(relative to the root where the `Darnfile` lives)
via the `path` argument to `darn::init()` and `darn::done()`
helps working around this problem.
